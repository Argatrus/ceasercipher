This project is for a simple encryption and decryption using ceaser cipher. This is a part of a bigger encrypting project...

Remember to install nltk: pip install nltk

Consists of a parent subprogram with three child programs...

Encryption will return ciphertext: ceaser('encrypt', scale here in integer format, 'your text here in string format')

Decryption with a key will be: ceaser('decrypt', key, 'ciphertext')

Decryption without a key is: ceaser('decrypt', 0, 'ciphertext')
